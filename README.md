## Description

---

- This GUI was developed to provide an easy method for presenting speech tasks
at various presentation levels, including adaptive changes in presentation 
level, without having to recalibrate each time the level changes. 

- Additionally, this GUI allows point-and-click scoring and provides session 
data at the end in .csv format. This avoids data entry errors (e.g., transferring 
paper scores into a database), as well as provides a common format for storing
scores.
